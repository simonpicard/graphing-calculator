This program allows you to plot functions in a graph.

The text box on the right is the place where you have to fill in the functions of x, one per line.
All functions from the math module are allowed.

The graph will be centered according to the numbers given in the text entries center x and y.
These numbers must be real numbers.

The numbers of units represented on the x and y axis will be given by range x and y.
These numbers must be strictly positive real numbers.

The space between two recalculated points will be given by step, once two points are calculated they will be connected.
This number must be a strictly positive real.

You can export the graph as a ppm file by clicking on the associated button.

By right-clicking on a surface in the graph, a pop-up window will open and give you its size.
The area will be calculated by two methods, giving their execution time.
